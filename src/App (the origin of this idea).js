        "Ignore this, this were my thoughts when starting this project" i'm
        ramu firt step should be learn how to interact with api, so dont think
        like you are a builder just learn how to interact with public apis
        properly next step is to analyse how did they build them, so that it
        helps how to build our own next step is to build some real useful stuff
        using those apis next build your own apis this is only frontend practice
        of nodejs, these projects will not help you build an api, but will help
        you to learn how to interact with existing popular apis. so these
        projects does not contain any backend, they may. learning from existing
        apis is the best way to get an idea how to build our own I will be
        interacting with below apis, try to build sometning exiting from public
        apis given in this resourse{" "}

        . In future, I want to make this open ended, so that people can add
        their own projects on the apis below or some other public apis they
        find, so that it will be helpful for people just getting started to pick
        any project of thier choice for thier practice In future, I will add a
        guide on how to add your own projects in readme of this project
