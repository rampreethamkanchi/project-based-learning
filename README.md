## Project-Based Learning Website

We can build a **Project-Based Learning Platform** designed to help learners find and engage with hands-on projects across various domains. The platform will feature:

- **GitHub repositories**, website links, and any other resources related to specific projects.
- **Ratings** and a variety of **filters** such as skill levels (Basic, Medium, Advanced), making it easier for learners to find suitable projects.
- The goal is to make it easy for learners to get hands-on learning in any domain.

### Vision
Initially, I started it for practicing working with APIs, but I could'nt find standard practice projects which will give enough experience. So I thought if crowd sourced ratings and suggesions can be in a place, learning anything will be easy.

We will build frontend first and then start backend
